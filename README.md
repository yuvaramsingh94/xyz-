This document provides the necessary steps to run My trained model through the grader program provided by Udacity for lyft perception challenge . since i am not eligible for Lyft job interview (Not having US work permit) , i am looking to be a part of intensive career preparation seminar and other relevant job opportunities .

### Instructions to Run 

* Step 1 : open up a terminal inside the workspace (change directory if you are not inside the workspace)
* Step 2 : Run.—- `./preinstall_script.sh `
* Step 3 : change directory into test/code.—------   `cd test/code`
* Step 4 : Run my model through this code —- `grader 'python final_sub.py' `

### File structure
inside the folder test , you can ﬁnd two folders namely code and model . the code folder consist of the inference code which can take in the video path as an argument , load in the model , perform inference and provide the required output . the code is designed in a way to load the correct model from the model folder . it is required to not change the folder structure since the model path inside the code is hard-coded . test —(code,model)
