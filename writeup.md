# Project: Perception Pick & Place

## Exercise 1, 2 and 3 Pipeline Implemented

### Complete Exercise 1 steps. Pipeline for filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented.

#### Point-cloud data is collected from the robots RGB-D camera and first filtered to remove data outliers with the use of a nearest-neighbour, standard deviation filter.

#### After  Voxel Grid Downsampling, take in the cloud into a passthrough through Z axis(what's more, i can also use X or Y axis, and that's what  I did in the project).

####  RANSAC is an algorithm, that you can use to identify points in your dataset that belong to a particular model.Here the inliers is table and the outliers is all other objects.

### Complete Exercise 2 steps: Pipeline including clustering for segmentation implemented.

#### After the above code, Euclidean Clustering is needed to  locate and segment each cluster for classification. 
#### Below is an example of the clustered outliers point cloudï¼š

### Complete Exercise 3 Steps. Features extracted and SVM trained. Object recognition implemented.

#### After the clusters have been located, what I need to do is to use SVM to classify the totally 6 objects whose features are already generated. 
#### I have to point out that although in the Exercise , other complex kernels seems to performed better than linear kernel. But there's a very deadly problem: Overfitting! I tried to use rbf kernel which seems good . However, it can always misread other objects as "book". The performance in the confusion matrices, the accuracy and score are also the  way to see how the model perform. So, generally speaking, I think that linear kernel is the best in SVM.svc() function. Thanks to a friend of mine reminded me of the conclusion of Deeplearning.ai : when features are in a large amount but samples are lack, linear kernel is often better. Because in such large features, it is probably that the data are linearly separable. Although I think that rbf can also express the result of linear kernel in a way, but , as I said above, rbf is easy to overfit the data.
#### So my SVM parameters are like this(seems so simply but it took me some times to realize that, I used rbf before and it also perform well in confusion matrices):

                                           C=1.5,kernel='linear'* others are default
#### See my previous rbf confusion matrices and score:

That seems good ! But in fact, just in the test_world 1, it misrecognized to "soap" as "book"!!!!!!

## Pick and Place Setup

The test environment's cover three different combinations of various objects. The potential objects to be observed are:

1.    biscuits
2.    soap
3.    soap2
4.    book
5.   glue
6.    sticky_notes
7.    snacks
8.    eraser
